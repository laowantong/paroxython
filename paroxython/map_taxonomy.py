r"""
Translate labels into taxa.

## Description

This step comes after `paroxython.label_programs` has tagged a program with the **labels** specified
in `spec.md`. Its purpose is to convert these labels into **taxa** based on the rules defined (by
default) in `taxonomy.tsv`.

## Example

Let's return to the Jupyter notebook's cell given in the introduction:

```python
1   %%paroxython labels
2   def fibonacci(n):
3       result = []
4       (a, b) = (0, 1)
5       while a < n:
6           result.append(a)
7           (a, b) = (b, a + b)
8       return result
```

Note that the magic cell-command `%%paroxython` is now called with a `labels` argument. This
produces the following output (limited for brevity to its first four rows):

| Label | Lines |
|:--|:--|
| `addition_operator` | 7 |
| `assignment` | 3, 4, 7 |
| `assignment_lhs_identifier:a` | 4, 7 |
| `assignment_lhs_identifier:b` | 4, 7 |

These labels are low-level tags, intended for internal use only. They still need to be translated
into the following taxa, which are the only tags of interest to the end user. For instance,
`"addition_operator"` will be translated into `"operator/arithmetic/addition"` (note that, unlike
a label, a taxon may feature one or several slashes, which indicate the nesting of notions). More
examples are given in the dedicated [section](user_manual/index.html#taxonomy) of the user manual.

In fact, both labels and taxa are couples:

- Label: `("addition_operator", [(7, 7, "...")])`.
- Taxon: `("operator/arithmetic/addition", {(7, 7, "..."): 1})`.

The second member is slightly more complicated than a list of line numbers:

- For a label, it is a list of triples consisting of the start and end of the spanning lines,
and a third member, the path (here denoted by the ellipsis), which identifies unambiguously the
start of the span.
- For a taxon, it is a **bag**, i.e. a dictionary associating such triples with the count of their
occurrences in the program.

The paths being left untouched by the conversion, we will omit them from now on.

### Deduplication

- Labels:
    - `("assignment", [(3, 3), (4, 4), (7, 7)])`.
    - `("single_assignment:result", [(3, 3)])`.
    - `("parallel_assignment", [(4, 4), (7, 7)])`.
    - `("slide", [(7, 7)])`.
- Taxa:
    - `("var/assignment/explicit/single", {(3, 3): 1})`.
    - `("var/assignment/explicit/parallel", {(4, 4): 1})`.
    - `("var/assignment/explicit/parallel/slide", {(7, 7): 1})`.

The example program features three distinct assignments. They can be categorized into:

- A single assignment on line 3  (`result = []`).
- A parallel assignment on line 4 (`(a, b) = (0, 1)`).
- A parallel assignment where a couple is updated by “sliding” the value of its second member to the
first position, on line 7 (`(a, b) = (b, a + b)`).

As you can see, labelling all these produces a lot of span redundancies. For instance, the
assignment of line 7 is labelled three times, as `"assignment"`, `"parallel_assignment"` and
`"slide"`. Since the labels are not structured, this is the best that we can do.

Enter the taxa, whose production is triggered by the following taxonomy rows:

Taxa (replacement patterns)    | Labels (search patterns)
:------------------------------|:-----------------------
`var/assignment/explicit` | `assignment\b.*`
`var/assignment/explicit/parallel` | `parallel_assignment:\d+`
`var/assignment/explicit/parallel/slide` | `slide`
`var/assignment/explicit/single` | `single_assignment:.+`

Initially, the conversion produces as many redundant spans as for the labels:

- Taxa:
    - `("var/assignment/explicit", {(3, 3): 1, (4, 4): 1, (7, 7): 1})`.
    - `("var/assignment/explicit/single", {(3, 3): 1})`.
    - `("var/assignment/explicit/parallel", {(4, 4): 1, (7, 7): 1})`.
    - `("var/assignment/explicit/parallel/slide", {(7, 7): 1})`.

However, because of the tree-like structuring of taxa, it is possible to remove those occurrences
that are subject to further characterization (e.g., `var/assignment/explicit/parallel` on line 7 is
further characterized as `var/assignment/explicit/parallel/slide`), resulting in the list of taxa
given at the start of the section.

Note that the removal of spans has finally led to the elimination of the overly generic taxon
`var/assignment/explicit`.

                associating label (search) patterns with taxon (replacement) patterns. For better
                readability, the taxa are listed on the first column, and the corresponding labels
                (sometimes very long) on the second column. If not specified, the

            3. Distribute the remaining rows into two different accumulators, depending on the
            “literality” of the label pattern:
                - `self.literal_labels` is a dictionary associating every **literal** label pattern,
                that it to say, a label name, with a list of taxon names. Most of these lists are
                singletons, but one can imagine that a unique label name could be associated with
                multiple taxon names. As a dictionary, it allows O(1) lookups of any given label
                pattern.
                - `self.compiled_labels` is a list of couples, of which the first member is a
                **compiled** label pattern, and the second member is a replacement pattern which may
                contain backreferences to one or several capture groups of the label pattern. For
                instance, it can include the couple `(regex.compile(r"index_shape:(\d+)$"),
                r"subscript/index/shape/\1")`, which will be used to “translate” any occurrence of
                the label name `"index_shape:3"` into the taxon name `"subscript/index/shape/3"`.
                As an associative list, it only allows O(n) lookups a given label pattern.

        Description:
            First of all, when a label looks like a taxon, it is returned without further ado.

            For the rest, most of the work was done during the initialization, by constructing the
            map `self.literal_labels` and the list `self.compiled_labels`. The given label name is
            first looked up in the map, then matched successively against every regular expression
            stored in the list.

            The second step may be useful even if the first one has already produced one or several
            translations. For instance, take a taxonomy defining the following associations:

            Taxa (replacement patterns)         | Labels (search patterns)
            :-----------------------------------|:-----------------------
            `call/subroutine/builtin/casting/\1`  | `free_call:(list|dict)`
            `type/sequence/list`                | `free_call:list`

            Suppose now that we pass the label `"free_call:list"`. The lookup in the map produces
            a first translation: `"type/sequence/list"`. However, the linear search in the list
            produces a second translation, namely: `"call/subroutine/builtin/casting/list"`.

            >>> a_taxonomy_instance.get_taxon_name_list("free_call:list")

            ]

            Therefore, the complexity of this function is linear in every case. However, its
            [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) avoids having to translate the
            same label more than one time
            (cf. [lru_cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache)).

        3           n = n // 2
        4       else:
        5           n = 3 * n + 1
        ```
        It features exactly one literal integer on lines 1 and 3, and exactly two on lines 2 and 5.
        Moreover, one of the literals of line 2 is zero. Therefore, the program is originally tagged
        with the following two couples (among others):
        ```python
        [
            ...
            ("type/number/integer/literal",
                {
                    (1, 1): 1,
                    (2, 2): 2,
                    (3, 3): 1,
                    (5, 5): 2,
                }
            ),
            ("type/number/integer/literal/zero", {(2, 2): 1}),
            ...
        ]
        ```
        ..tip::
            In the dictionary above, `(5, 5): 2` means that the taxon `"type/number/integer/literal"`
            has 2 distinct occurrences spanning the lines 5 to 5 (namely, `3` and `1`). Such a
            “counter” dictionary is called a _bag_, or _multiset_.

        Now, every occurrence of a given taxon **is** an occurrence of any of its prefix. For
        instance, an occurrence of the literal integer `0` is obviously an occurrence of a literal
        integer. Currently, it is counted twice. The purpose of this function is to remove such
        redundant counts. The longest taxon will be kept, and its prefix count decreased. Finally,
        the following deduplicated list will be returned:
        ```python
        [
            ...
            ("type/number/integer/literal",
                {
                    (1, 1): 1,
                    (2, 2): 1, # decremented
                    (3, 3): 1,
                    (5, 5): 2,
                }
            ),
            ("type/number/integer/literal/zero", {(2, 2): 1}),
            ...
        ]
        ```
        Decrementing a span count may result in the deletion of a taxon. For instance, on the same
        program:
        ```python
        [
            ...
            ("flow/loop", {(1, 5): 1},
            ("flow/loop/exit/late", {(1, 5): 1},
            ("flow/loop/while", {(1, 5): 1},
            ...
        ]
        ```
        … becomes after deduplication:
        ```python

            ...

            ...
        ]
